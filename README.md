## Overview

This project is a JavaScript-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, create variables, and store calculation history. The application is designed with a web-based interface and includes features such as keyboard interaction and input validation.

## Features

- **Calculator Functionality**: Users can perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Variable Creation**: Users can create variables with specific names and values to be used in calculations.
- **History Management**: The application stores the results of calculations in a history table, allowing users to review past computations.
- **Keyboard Interaction**: Users can use the keyboard to trigger calculations and clear operations.
- **Input Validation**: Input fields are validated to ensure only valid characters are entered.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the structure of the web application, including input fields for the calculator and variable creation.
- `style.css`: Provides the styling for the application, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface.
- `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the calculator's operations, event handling, and input validation.

## Key Functions

- **calculate()**: Handles button clicks for performing calculations and clearing input.
- **equals()**: Evaluates the current expression in the input field and displays the result.
- **check()**: Validates variable names and prevents duplicates.
- **addrow()**: Adds a new row to the history table with the current calculation result.
- **deleterow()**: Removes a row from the history table.
- **addinput()**: Adds the clicked history result back to the calculator input for further calculations.

## Installation and Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salmanrafiqq/PocketEscape
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to run the application.
3. Use the input fields and buttons to perform calculations and manage variables.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more advanced mathematical functions.
- Improve input validation with more comprehensive error handling.
